    "# Temporal Feature Analysis - Key Insights & Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a series of experiments adding temporal features to a simple XGBoost baseline, we discovered that **temporal continuity is the most critical signal for indoor location prediction**. The dominant beacon from 2-3 seconds ago is more important than the current beacon reading, validating the hypothesis that BLE location data has strong sequential dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental Results Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment 1: Spatial Features Only (Top-3 Beacons)\n",
    "**Features:** \n",
    "- `top_1_beacon`, `top_1_beacon_pct`\n",
    "- `top_2_beacon`, `top_2_beacon_pct`\n",
    "- `top_3_beacon`, `top_3_beacon_pct`\n",
    "- Total: 6 features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:**\n",
    "- **Macro F1: 0.2003**\n",
    "- Decline of -33.2% from baseline (0.30)\n",
    "- Only 1/16 rooms with F1 > 0.5\n",
    "- 9/16 rooms with F1 < 0.2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Finding:** Spatial features alone (which beacons are strongest) are insufficient without temporal context.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment 2: Adding 1-Second Temporal Lookback\n",
    "**Features Added:**\n",
    "- Previous window (1 second ago): `prev_top_1/2/3_beacon` and `prev_top_1/2/3_beacon_pct`\n",
    "- `beacon_persistence` (overlap score between current and previous)\n",
    "- Total: 13 features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:**\n",
    "- **Macro F1: 0.2605** (+30% improvement from Experiment 1!)\n",
    "- 3/16 rooms with F1 > 0.5\n",
    "- 7/16 rooms with F1 < 0.2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Major Improvements:**\n",
    "- Kitchen: 0.29 → 0.57 (+97%)\n",
    "- Room 520: 0.02 → 0.31 (+1450%)\n",
    "- Room 512: 0.54 → 0.59 (+9%)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Critical Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Temporal Dependencies Are Stronger Than Spatial Signatures**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evidence:**\n",
    "- Top 4 most important features are ALL from previous time steps (prev_2s, prev_3s, prev_1s)\n",
    "- Current beacon (`top_1_beacon`) ranks only 3rd in importance\n",
    "- Looking back 2-3 seconds gives more signal than current readings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** \n",
    "Location is best predicted by **where you've been** rather than just **where you are**. This makes intuitive sense: a person in a hallway who came from the kitchen has a different beacon pattern than someone in the hallway coming from a room.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Rooms Have Characteristic Temporal Signatures, Not Just Spatial Signatures**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evidence from per-class performance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stable Rooms (High F1 scores):**\n",
    "- Kitchen (F1=0.66): Beacon 14 appears consistently for multiple seconds\n",
    "- Nurse station (F1=0.57): Beacon 9 is very persistent\n",
    "- Room 512 (F1=0.57): Beacon 23 dominates with high temporal stability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transition Zones (Low F1 scores):**\n",
    "- Hallway (F1=0.00): Beacons change rapidly second-by-second\n",
    "- Cleaning (F1=0.08): High variability in beacon patterns\n",
    "- Rooms 517, 518 (F1=0.00): Rare classes with insufficient temporal patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- **Stable locations** have beacons that persist over 3-5+ seconds\n",
    "- **Transition zones** have rapid beacon changes with no persistence\n",
    "- The model struggles with transition zones because they lack temporal consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Sequential Data Requires Sequential Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The XGBoost Limitation:**\n",
    "- XGBoost treats each time window as independent\n",
    "- We manually engineered temporal features (prev_1s, prev_2s, prev_3s) to capture sequences\n",
    "- This is a **workaround** - we're forcing a non-sequential model to handle sequential data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evidence:**\n",
    "- We had to explicitly add `prev_Xs_top_Y_beacon` features\n",
    "- Feature importance shows ALL temporal lags are important (1s, 2s, 3s)\n",
    "- We're essentially asking XGBoost to learn \"if beacon sequence is [A, A, A, B] then location is X\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "The data is fundamentally **sequential/temporal** in nature. XGBoost with manual temporal features is a proof-of-concept, but not the optimal approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Movement Patterns Matter**\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the floor plan and beacon layout:\n",
    "- Kitchen (beacon 14) → Cafeteria (beacon 4) is a common transition\n",
    "- Both rooms can see beacon 4, but the **sequence** distinguishes them:\n",
    "  - Coming FROM kitchen: [14, 4, 9] → [4, 14] → [4] (beacon 14 fades)\n",
    "  - Staying IN cafeteria: [4] → [4] → [4] (beacon 4 persistent)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "Location prediction is not just \"which beacons do I see?\" but \"**how did I get here?**\" - the trajectory/path matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Takeaways for Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What We Validated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temporal continuity is critical** - previous seconds are more informative than current readings\n",
    "2. **Longer temporal context helps** - 3-second lookback outperforms 1-second lookback\n",
    "3. **Stable rooms benefit most from temporal features** - rooms with persistent beacons saw huge F1 improvements\n",
    "4. **Transition zones remain challenging** - hallways and cleaning areas have low temporal consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Current Approach Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **XGBoost is not designed for sequences**\n",
    "   - Treats each window independently\n",
    "   - Requires manual feature engineering (prev_1s, prev_2s, etc.)\n",
    "   - Cannot learn complex temporal patterns automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fixed temporal window (3 seconds) may be suboptimal**\n",
    "   - Some rooms might need 5-10 seconds of context\n",
    "   - Transition zones might need shorter windows\n",
    "   - One-size-fits-all window doesn't adapt to different movement speeds\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lost granularity**\n",
    "   - We only use top-3 beacons, ignoring 22 others\n",
    "   - RSSI values are reduced to percentages, losing actual signal strength\n",
    "   - Baseline (125 features with mean/std/min/max) had richer information\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No trajectory modeling**\n",
    "   - Features are discrete: [beacon_A, beacon_B, beacon_C]\n",
    "   - Cannot model smooth transitions or movement direction\n",
    "   - Cannot distinguish \"moving toward X\" vs \"moving away from X\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Recommended Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Use Sequence Models (LSTM/GRU/Transformer)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** These models are designed for sequential data and can automatically learn temporal dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- No need to manually engineer prev_1s, prev_2s features\n",
    "- Can learn arbitrary-length temporal patterns\n",
    "- Can model complex trajectory patterns\n",
    "- Hidden state captures \"movement history\" implicitly\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation Approach:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input sequence: [window_t-10, window_t-9, ..., window_t-1, window_t]\n",
    "Each window: [beacon_1_rssi, beacon_2_rssi, ..., beacon_25_rssi]\n",
    "Output: room_label at time t\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM/GRU processes the sequence and predicts location based on:\n",
    "- Current beacon signals\n",
    "- Recent history (automatically learned)\n",
    "- Movement patterns (encoded in hidden state)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Use All 25 Beacons, Not Just Top-3**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** We're losing information by only keeping top-3 beacons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "- Create a 25-dimensional RSSI vector per window (one value per beacon)\n",
    "- Use -100 dBm for beacons not detected (or 0 after normalization)\n",
    "- Feed entire vector to LSTM/GRU\n",
    "- Let the model learn which beacons are important (rather than pre-selecting top-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Add RSSI-Based Spatial Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** Beacon identity matters, but so does signal strength and relative differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features to add:**\n",
    "- Pairwise RSSI differences: `rssi_beacon_i - rssi_beacon_j`\n",
    "- Signal ratios: `rssi_beacon_i / rssi_beacon_j`\n",
    "- Signal dominance: `max_rssi - mean_rssi`\n",
    "- These capture **spatial relationships** that are invariant to absolute signal fluctuations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Hierarchical Modeling: Trajectory + Location**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** Model both \"where am I moving?\" and \"where am I now?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two-stage approach:**\n",
    "- Stage 1: Predict trajectory/movement direction from beacon sequences\n",
    "- Stage 2: Predict location given trajectory + current beacons\n",
    "- This explicitly models the \"how did I get here?\" aspect\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative: Multi-task learning:**\n",
    "- Primary task: Predict location\n",
    "- Auxiliary task: Predict next beacon in sequence\n",
    "- Forces model to learn temporal dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Handle Class Imbalance with Temporal Oversampling**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Minority classes (rooms 517, 518, 501) have very few samples and zero F1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:**\n",
    "- Oversample minority class sequences (not just windows)\n",
    "- Use SMOTE on sequence embeddings (from LSTM hidden states)\n",
    "- Apply class weights based on temporal stability (stable rooms get lower weight)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Incorporate Physical Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** A person cannot teleport between distant rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approaches:**\n",
    "- Add floor plan distance as a feature (distance between room_t-1 and room_t)\n",
    "- Use Conditional Random Fields (CRF) on top of LSTM predictions to enforce spatial consistency\n",
    "- Add transition probability matrix (P(room_j | room_i)) learned from training data\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Concrete Next Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment 4: LSTM with Full Beacon Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Architecture:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: Sequence of 10 windows, each with 25 RSSI values\n",
    "       Shape: (batch_size, sequence_length=10, features=25)\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM Layer 1: 128 units, return sequences\n",
    "LSTM Layer 2: 64 units, return last output\n",
    "Dense Layer: 32 units, ReLU\n",
    "Output Layer: num_classes units, Softmax\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss: Categorical cross-entropy\n",
    "Optimizer: Adam\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Impact:**\n",
    "- Macro F1: 0.35 - 0.45 (conservative estimate)\n",
    "- Should especially help hallway, cleaning, and transition zones\n",
    "- Better modeling of movement patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this should work:**\n",
    "- LSTM naturally handles sequential dependencies (no manual prev_Xs features)\n",
    "- Can learn longer-term patterns (10+ seconds)\n",
    "- Hidden state encodes \"movement trajectory\"\n",
    "- More expressive than XGBoost for time series\n",

    "> (Class imbalance problem, but fundamentally these classes are not unique or rare events in the data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ VALIDATED:** Rooms like 517, 518, 501 have low F1 not because they're \"rare events\" but because they have insufficient **temporal consistency**. The issue is data quality/quantity for these specific locations, not algorithmic bias.\n",
    "\n",

    "> (If you can characterize the signal patterns of surrounding BLE beacons when in a room => that's the key to the problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "**✅ VALIDATED:** But with a twist! It's not just \"which beacons are around me\" (spatial signature) but \"**how have the beacons changed as I moved here**\" (temporal + spatial signature). The key is characterizing the **temporal evolution** of beacon patterns.\n",

    "\n",
    "The experiments with manual temporal features were a **critical proof-of-concept** that validated the temporal dependency hypothesis. However, the current approach (XGBoost + manual feature engineering) is hitting its limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The path forward is clear:**\n",
    "1. Move to sequence models (LSTM/GRU) that naturally handle temporal data\n",
    "2. Use full beacon vectors (25 beacons) with RSSI values, not just top-3\n",
    "3. Add spatial relationship features (RSSI ratios/differences)\n",
    "4. Incorporate longer temporal context (5-10 seconds)\n",
    "5. Apply physical constraints (movement models, floor plan)\n",
    "\n",
    "The temporal analysis showed that **location is a function of trajectory, not just position**. Future models must capture this temporal-spatial relationship to achieve good performance on all classes, including challenging transition zones like hallways.\n",
